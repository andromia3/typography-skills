# Editorial web typography

Where typography stops receding. Editorial pages carry voice, and voice is carried
by the parts around the body text as much as by the body text itself.

## 1. When to invoke

- Article, essay, documentation, or long-form templates.
- Marketing and landing pages with substantial copy.
- Pull quotes, drop caps, captions, bylines, footnotes, figure treatment.
- Art-directed or per-story layouts.
- An article template that "feels flat".

**Do not** invoke for dense product UI (`ui-component-typography`) or for the body
setting itself (`body-text-and-reading`).

## 2. Required context

- The **real content inventory** — does every story have a pull quote, a hero
  image, a subtitle? Templates fail on the story that lacks them.
- **Story length range**, shortest to longest.
- Whether layouts are **templated** or **art-directed per story**.
- Whether content is authored in **Markdown/CMS** (constrains what's expressible).
- Brand voice, and how far type may carry it.

## 3. Invariant principles

- **The body text is the product.** Every editorial device exists to serve reading,
  not to decorate around it. If a device interrupts reading without repaying it,
  remove it.
- **Secondary elements need a distinct, consistent voice.** Captions, bylines, and
  footnotes should be recognisable as a class at a glance, and consistent across
  every story.
- **A device must degrade.** A drop cap must work when the paragraph is two lines;
  a pull quote must work when there's no quote; a hero must work with no image.
- **Vertical rhythm is felt, not measured.** Consistent spacing between elements
  reads as competence; the reader never counts it.
- **Space above binds, space below separates.** A subhead belongs to the section
  that follows it, so its space above must exceed its space below.
- **Expressiveness is bounded by readability**, and readability is bounded by
  accessibility (rule 1).

## 4. Context-dependent heuristics

**Measure.** Editorial is where the measure guidance in `body-text-and-reading`
matters most — this is genuine continuous reading. Cap the column; let margins
absorb extra viewport width. Full-bleed images may break the column; text should
not.

**Subheads.** Give them clear separation from the preceding paragraph and tight
proximity to the following one. Two levels is usually enough. Keep the semantic
heading level correct independently of size.

**Pull quotes.** They exist to pull a scanner into the text. Rules:
- Use text that already appears in the article; don't introduce new content.
- Never let it disrupt the measure of the body text around it awkwardly — either
  break the column fully or sit clearly outside it.
- It must be skippable. A reader reading straight through should not stumble.
- If the CMS can't guarantee one exists, the template must look complete without it.

**Drop caps.** Genuinely hard on the web. Requirements:
- Align the cap's top to the first line's cap height and its baseline to a body
  baseline — `initial-letter` does this properly where supported; float hacks
  approximate it badly.
- Never apply to a paragraph shorter than the cap is tall.
- Skip when the paragraph starts with a quotation mark or a number.
- Ensure the first word is still readable as a word by screen readers — a drop cap
  built by splitting the letter into its own element can be announced separately.

**Paragraph demarcation, with numbers.** Rutter's concrete limits: indent by **at
least 1em** if you indent, and separate by **no more than 1em** if you space. Below
1em an indent doesn't read as intentional; above 1em the paragraphs stop cohering
into a text block. And don't use stylised paragraph breaks (dinkuses, ornaments)
without a reason — they interrupt.

**A standfirst should stand first.** The intro paragraph that summarises the piece
needs to be visibly distinct from body copy — larger, or a different weight — and it
needs to come before the body, not float beside it. If it looks like the first
paragraph, it isn't doing its job.

**Block quotes are not pull quotes.** A block quote is *quoted source material* the
reader should read in sequence. A pull quote is *repeated text* used to bait a
scanner. They need different treatments, and styling every block quote as a giant
centred pull quote is a common and confusing default.

**Links, lists, and emphasis.**

- **Make links clear but unobtrusive.** They must be identifiable without scanning
  the page for colour, and identifiable by something other than colour alone.
- **Don't underline for emphasis.** On the web an underline means "link." Use
  italics for emphasis, weight for strong emphasis.
- **Avoid faux bold and italic** — if the family lacks the style, don't synthesize it.
- **Treat lists as text to be read**, not as data dumps: they need the same measure
  discipline, leading, and spacing care as paragraphs.

**Semantics come first, styling second.** Rutter: "establish the semantics up front."
Decide what a piece of text *is* — `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<cite>`, `<q>`, `<abbr>`,
`<figure>`/`<figcaption>`, `<blockquote>` — before deciding how it looks. Semantic
markup drives assistive technology, translation, search, and reader modes; visual
styling that floats free of it is decoration that only sighted users receive. A
`<span class="bold">` communicates nothing to a screen reader.

**Captions.** Small, clearly subordinate, consistently placed, and **still meeting
contrast**. Grey captions are the most common contrast failure on editorial sites.

**Figures and footnotes.** Use `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` for semantics. Footnotes
need a return path; a link that leaves the reader stranded is a defect.

**Art direction vs. template.** Per-story art direction produces the best pages and
does not scale. Be explicit about which you're building. A common resolution: a
strong template plus a small set of sanctioned variations (full-bleed, wide,
column) that authors select.

**Layering.** Type on Screen's term for building a composition in depth rather than
in sequence — type over imagery, type behind or in front of a scrim, and *additive
layering*, where separate styles within a family act as distinct structural or
decorative elements (Carter's Walker uses five "snap-on" serif styles this way).
Two rules: every layer that carries text must independently meet contrast, and the
stacking must survive the layer beneath changing — a CMS-driven hero image will not
always be the dark, calm photo the design was made against. Use a scrim or a
contrast-guaranteed band rather than hoping.

**Navigation and wayfinding type.** Nav labels are the shortest, most-scanned text
in the product and the first to break in translation. Keep them one line, keep
their voice distinct from body text (usually size and weight, not a second face),
and mark the current location with something other than colour alone. In long-form
editorial, wayfinding also means in-page structure: subheads a reader can scan, and
a visible sense of where they are in a long piece.

**Wrap control.** `text-wrap: balance` on headings and pull quotes prevents the
one-word last line; `text-wrap: pretty` on body paragraphs handles orphans. Both
degrade silently. See `microtypography`.

## 5. Failure patterns

| Pattern | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Every article looks the same and flat | Only body + h2 styled | Give captions, bylines, quotes a real voice |
| Drop cap overlaps the second line | Float hack without baseline alignment | `initial-letter`, or drop the device |
| Pull quote breaks reading flow | Placed inside the measure, mid-sentence | Move outside the column or to a paragraph break |
| Template collapses without a hero image | Device assumed present | Design the absent case |
| Captions unreadable | Grey-on-white below 4.5:1 | Raise contrast |
| Subhead looks attached to the paragraph above | Symmetric margins | More space above than below |
| Spacing inconsistent between stories | Ad-hoc margins, no rhythm | Systematise spacing |
| Long article has no wayfinding | No subheads or progress cue | Add structural subheads |
| Heading breaks to a one-word line | No wrap control | `text-wrap: balance` |

## 6. Evaluation procedure

1. Render the **shortest** and **longest** real story in the template.
2. Render a story **missing** each optional device — no hero, no pull quote, no
   subtitle, no author image.
3. Read one full story at real size. Did any device interrupt without repaying?
4. Check subhead spacing: above > below, on every level.
5. Check the measure through the whole article, including around floated elements.
6. Contrast-check captions, bylines, footnotes, and any grey text.
7. Verify semantic structure: sequential headings, `<figure>`/`<figcaption>`,
   footnote return links.
8. Apply the WCAG 1.4.12 override and zoom to 200%.
9. Check heading and pull-quote wrapping at the narrowest breakpoint.

## 7. Output format

```
Template: <name> — <templated | art-directed | template + variants>
Body setting: <deferred to body-text-and-reading>
Voice elements: caption <spec> · byline <spec> · pull quote <spec> · footnote <spec>
Devices used: <drop cap | pull quote | full-bleed | …>
  Degradation: <device> without <precondition> → <behaviour>
Rhythm: space-above/below per element — subhead binding correct: <yes/no>
Contrast: captions <n> · bylines <n> · footnotes <n>
Tested: shortest <pass/fail> · longest <pass/fail> · missing-devices <pass/fail>
```

## 8. Examples

**Blog template that "feels flat" despite good body type.**

> The body setting is fine — the flatness is that nothing except `h2` has a voice.
> Captions, byline, and reading time are all body-size grey text, so the page reads
> as one undifferentiated block. Give the secondary class a real identity: smaller,
> one weight up, a slight tracking increase, and a consistent placement — but raise
> the grey to pass 4.5:1, which it currently fails. Add one structural device (a
> pull quote at a paragraph break, not mid-sentence) and design the no-quote case
> so short posts don't look broken.

**Drop cap request on a docs site.**

> Recommending against it. Docs paragraphs are frequently two lines, often start
> with a code term or a number, and are re-ordered by authors — three conditions
> where a drop cap fails. If the goal is signalling article start, a larger,
> tracked lead-in phrase gives the same signal, degrades to nothing, and doesn't
> risk the screen-reader split that letter-in-its-own-element drop caps cause.

## 9. Counterexamples

- ❌ "Add a drop cap, it looks editorial." — Fails on short paragraphs, on
  quote/number openings, and often for screen readers.
- ❌ Pull-quote text that appears nowhere in the article. — It's a pull quote, not
  a subtitle.
- ❌ "The template looks great." — with the one story that has every optional
  element populated.
- ❌ Grey captions at #999 on white. — 2.8:1; fails 1.4.3.
- ❌ Symmetric margins on subheads. — Visually attaches them to the wrong section.
- ❌ Letting the column widen with the viewport indefinitely on an article page.
- ❌ "Art-direct every story." — Unless there's a designer per story, this is a
  promise the system can't keep.
