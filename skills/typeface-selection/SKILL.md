name: typeface-selection
description: Use when choosing or replacing a typeface — "which font should we use", evaluating candidates, building a type palette, or replacing a face that isn't working. Also use when a font must carry a brand tone, survive small sizes, support extra scripts, or fit a licensing and performance budget.

# Typeface selection

Selection is a constraint-satisfaction problem, not a taste contest. Taste
decides between the candidates that survive the constraints.

## 1. When to invoke

- Choosing a typeface for a product, brand, or document.
- Replacing a face that fails at some size, script, or medium.
- Building a type palette for a system.
- Auditing an inherited choice.

**Do not** invoke for combining faces (`typeface-pairing`) or for expressive
critique (`typography-critique`).

## 2. Required context

Do not name a font before you have these:

- **Roles required** — body, UI, display, data, code. Different constraints each.
- **Smallest and largest** sizes it must work at.
- **Scripts and languages** required, now and planned.
- **Weights and styles** genuinely needed (including true italics).
- **Figure requirements** — tabular for data, oldstyle for prose.
- **Licence and budget** — web, app, desktop, redistribution.
- **Performance budget** — see `font-loading-and-performance`.
- **Brand tone**, and any existing system constraint.
- **Medium** — screen, print, low-DPI, e-ink, embedded.

## 3. Invariant principles

- **Constraints first, taste last.** Script coverage, licensing, weights, and
  figures eliminate most candidates before aesthetics is consulted.
- **Judge at the size of use**, in the medium of use, with real content.
- **Serif vs. sans is not a legibility decision.** Research has failed to prove
  serifs improve reading speed or comprehension; "bias favors familiarity."
  (Lupton) Choose on tone and rendering behavior.
- **A typeface must be judged in running text**, not from its logotype-friendly
  showcase glyphs. Santa Maria: flourishes that look charming in a specimen "stick
  out in running text."
- **The face must survive its worst case**, not flatter its best — the longest
  German compound, the smallest label, the lowest-DPI screen.
- **Familiar is not a failure.** Familiarity aids reading.

## 4. Context-dependent heuristics

**By role.**

| Role | Prioritise |
|---|---|
| Body / long-form | Low-moderate contrast, open apertures, real italic, comfortable at 15–18px, wide language coverage |
| UI / dense product | Open apertures, distinguishable `1 l I` / `0 O`, tabular figures, tight vertical metrics, several weights |
| Display / brand | Character, distinctive forms, optical sizes if available; small-size behavior irrelevant |
| Data / tables | **Tabular figures mandatory**; unambiguous digits |
| Code | Monospace, disambiguated `0 O l 1 I`, clear punctuation |

**Reading tone from form.** Coles' value is explaining *why* a face reads a
certain way, from evidence:

| Wanted tone | Visible signals to look for |
|---|---|
| Neutral, systematic | Neo-Grotesque; regular proportions, low contrast, closed-ish apertures |
| Technical, precise | Geometric or Grotesque sans; uniform stroke, circular rounds |
| Humanist, warm | Angled axis, calligraphic trace, open apertures |
| Editorial, authoritative | Transitional/Rational serif; vertical axis, higher contrast |
| Contemporary, sturdy | Large x-height, low contrast, chunky serifs, very open apertures |
| Expressive, characterful | Distinctive terminals, unusual proportion |

Say the evidence out loud. "Feels modern" isn't a reason; "geometric construction,
near-uniform stroke weight, circular bowls" is.

**Building a palette** (Santa Maria). Keep a small personal set you know deeply
rather than searching fresh each time. Knowing how a face behaves at 12px, in
italic, in long German words, and under a fallback swap is worth more than novelty.

**Superfamilies** — a serif and sans sharing skeleton and metrics — solve pairing
and metric-matching at once. Strong default when a project needs both.

**Variable fonts** collapse many weights into one file. See `variable-fonts`.

**System font stacks** cost zero bytes and render natively. Legitimate for
performance-critical and utility interfaces; they forfeit brand distinctiveness and
render differently per platform.

## 5. Failure patterns

| Pattern | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Beautiful in the specimen, muddy at 14px | Judged at display size | Re-evaluate at the real size |
| Lovely until German/Polish shipped | Coverage unchecked | Verify glyph coverage per language |
| Numbers jitter in the table | Proportional figures | Require tabular figures |
| Faux italic renders | No true italic in family | Check styles, not just weights |
| Licence blocks app embedding | Web-only licence | Confirm every medium up front |
| Face "feels off" in body, fine in headings | Display face used for text | Separate display and text roles |
| Distinctive flourishes distract in paragraphs | Judged on isolated glyphs | Judge in running text |
| Chosen for readability because it's a serif | Folklore | Choose on tone and rendering |
| Nine weights shipped for a 4-weight design | No inventory | Ship only what renders |

## 6. Evaluation procedure

1. Write the constraint list (§2). Eliminate anything failing a hard constraint —
   script coverage, licence, required styles, tabular figures.
2. For survivors, render **real content** — the actual longest string, the actual
   smallest label — at the real sizes in the real medium.
3. Apply `typeface-anatomy` §7 to each: x-height, contrast, aperture, counters,
   `1 l I`, `0 O`.
4. Set a full paragraph in each and read it. Do any glyphs distract?
5. Test the worst case: longest locale word, densest table, smallest size, lowest
   DPI, reversed on dark.
6. Check the fallback: how far are its metrics from your candidate?
   (`font-loading-and-performance`)
7. Check the payload for the weights you'll actually ship.
8. Only now compare on tone — and state the visible evidence for the tone claim.

## 7. Output format

```
Roles: <body|ui|display|data|code>
Hard constraints: scripts <…> · styles <…> · figures <…> · licence <…> · budget <…>
Candidates eliminated: <face> — <which constraint>
Recommended: <face>
  Evidence: x-height <…>, contrast <…>, aperture <…>, digits <…>
  Tone claim: <tone> — because <visible signals>
  Worst case tested: <what>
  Payload: <n> files, <n> KB
Runner-up: <face> — <why not>
Unverified: <what wasn't rendered>
```

## 8. Examples

**Fintech dashboard, dense tables, EN + DE + PL, 4 weights, dark mode.**

> Hard constraints eliminate most candidates immediately: Polish requires
> `ą ć ę ł ń ó ś ź ż`, tables require tabular figures, and dark mode means the
> lightest weight must survive reversal. That leaves a Neo-Humanist or Grotesque
> sans with a full Latin Extended set. Recommending Inter: open apertures keep
> `c/e/s` distinct at 13px, `1 l I` and `0 O` are disambiguated, tabular figures
> ship, and one variable file covers all four weights. Verified with the longest
> German compound in the narrowest column and with the 300 weight reversed on the
> dark surface — 300 washed out, so the minimum shipping weight is 400.

## 9. Counterexamples

- ❌ "Use a serif for body text, it's more readable." — Unevidenced (Lupton).
- ❌ "This font is trending, let's use it." — Trend is rule 9, the bottom of the
  hierarchy.
- ❌ "It looked great in the specimen." — Specimens are set to flatter.
- ❌ "We'll add language support later." — Retrofitting script coverage usually
  means changing the face.
- ❌ "Ship all nine weights so we have options." — Every unused weight is pure cost.
- ❌ "Helvetica is neutral, so it's the safe choice." — Neo-Grotesque closed
  apertures actively hurt small-size UI legibility.
- ❌ "The brand deck says 'modern and human', so use a geometric sans." — Geometric
  construction reads *technical*; humanist forms read *human*. Match evidence to
  the claim.
